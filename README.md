# TSP project

Final project for the Methods and Models for Combinatorial Optimisation (MeMoCo) UNIPD course 2019/20.

It consists in two algorithms written in C++ to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem: an exact method which makes use of the IBM CPLEX Optimization Studio APIs for C and an heuristic method consisting in an implementation of the Lin-Kernighan heuristic.

The program has the following dependencies:
- g++ 7 or higher;
- IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio 12.8 or higher;
- Python 2.7.

The source files of the project report (in LaTeX) are provided in the `report` folder.
