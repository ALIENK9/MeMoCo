\section{Tests and results}
\label{sec:results}
The described heuristic has been tested on instances generated as described in \cref{sec:datasetgen}, and its solution has been compared with the optimal solution obtained with the exact method. This has been done for instances of size up to 110, since the exact method could not solve instances of bigger size.
