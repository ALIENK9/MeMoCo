abstract = {This paper discusses a highly effective heuristic procedure for generating optimum and near-optimum solutions for the symmetric traveling-salesman problem. The procedure is based on a general approach to heuristics that is believed to have wide applicability in combinatorial optimization problems. The procedure produces optimum solutions for all problems tested, “classical” problems appearing in the literature, as well as randomly generated test problems, up to 110 cities. Run times grow approximately as n2; in absolute terms, a typical 100-city problem requires less than 25 seconds for one case (GE635), and about three minutes to obtain the optimum with above 95 per cent confidence. }

abstract = "This paper describes an implementation of the Lin–Kernighan heuristic, one of the most successful methods for generating optimal or near-optimal solutions for the symmetric traveling salesman problem (TSP). Computational tests show that the implementation is highly effective. It has found optimal solutions for all solved problem instances we have been able to obtain, including a 13,509-city problem (the largest non-trivial problem instance solved to optimality today)."

abstract = "Ejection chain procedures are based on the notion of generating compound sequences of moves, leading from one solution to another, by linked steps in which changes in selected elements cause other elements to be “ejected from” their current state, position or value assignment. This paper introduces new ejection chain strategies designed to generate neighborhoods of compound moves with attractive properties for traveling salesman problems. These procedures derive from the principle of creating a reference structure that coordinates the options for the moves generated. We focus on ejection chain processes related to alternating paths, and introduce three reference structures, of progressively greater scope, that produce both classical and non-standard alternating path trajectories. Theorems and examples show that various rules for exploiting these structures can generate moves not available to customary neighborhood search approaches. We also provide a reference structure that makes it possible to generate a collection of alternating paths that precisely expresses the symmetric difference between two tours. In addition to providing new results related to generalized alternating paths, in directed and undirected graphs, we lay a foundation for achieving a combinatorial leverage effect, where an investment of polynomial effort yields solutions dominating exponential numbers of alternatives. These consequences are explored in a sequel."
