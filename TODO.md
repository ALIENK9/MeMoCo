# TODO list

- [x] Check intensification. (Keep the intersection of the best N, instead of everything)
- [X] Keep track of tours. It's a mess (could be improved)
- [ ] Early stopping if same solution has been found many times (while randomizing starts)
- [ ] Check what happens with K=2 (seems too good)
- [ ] Is NearestNeighbour really a good idea?
